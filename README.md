"# Machine-Learning-and-System-Identification-for-Adaptive-Optics" 

This repository contains COMSOL, LiveLink, Python and MATLAB codes we used to model a large scale Deformable Mirror (DM) model and to estimate such a model using 
machine learning and subspace identification techniques.

- The folder "subspace_identification" containts the codes used to identify the DM model using the Subspace Identification (SI) method.
- The folder "comsol" contains the MATLAB, Python, COMSOL, and LiveLink codes used to generate DM models. These models are used for subspace identification and machine learning.
