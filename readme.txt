This repository contains COMSOL, LiveLink, Python and MATLAB codes we used to model a large scale Deformable Mirror (DM) model and to estimate such a model using 
machine learning and subspace identification techniques.

- The folder "subspace_identification" containts the codes used to identify the DM model using the Subspace Identification (SI) method.
- The folder "comsol" contains the MATLAB, Python, COMSOL, and LiveLink codes used to generate DM models. These models are used for subspace identification and machine learning.

NOTE THAT FROM THE FOLDER COMSOL I HAD TO REMOVE TWO FILES 

frequency_response_and_eigenfrequencies_rayleigh_damping.mph

and

frequency_response_and_eigenfrequencies_spring_foundation.mph

DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY EXCEED 100MB FILE UPLOAD LIMIT. CONTACT ME IF YOU NEED THESE FILES.
